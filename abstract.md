Multi-dimensional arrays are ubiquitous in high-performance computing (HPC), but their absense from the C++ language standard is a long-standing and well-known limitation of its use for HPC.  This paper describes the design and implementation of `mdspan`, a proposed C++ standard multidimensional array view that is very likely to be merged into the ISO-C++ standard working draft early in the C++23 standardization cycle.  The proposal has taken more than five years and nearly a dozen iterations to achieve consensus.  As with many modern C++ features, performance portability has been a primary concern of the design from the beginning.  This paper describes the final form of the performance portable design, as well as a number of iterations along the way and the motivations that lead to discarding previous design iterations.  The final design includes customizations to address a number of specific performance portability concerns without introducing additional cognitive load to those who do not need that much flexibility.  Several specific concerns, and how they are addressed, are discussed herein.  Finally, we have provided a production-quality implementation of the proposal in its current (and likely final) form, and this work includes several benchmarks of this implementation aimed at demonstrating the zero-overhead nature of the modern design.
